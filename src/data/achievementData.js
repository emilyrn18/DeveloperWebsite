            title : 'Toward a Design Theory of Game-Mediated Social Experiences - A Study of Among Us',
            details : 'Authors: Haqq, D., Saaty, M., Rukaj, J. T., Marulkar, S., Israel, J., Newton, E., Patel, R., Tan, S., & McCrickard, D. S. Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected face-to-face social interaction with and among relational partners - relatives, friends, and others. Prior to the pandemic, many people relied on face-to-face social play experiences to help them maintain relationships and satisfy relatedness needs. However, growing coronavirus-related concerns have made such activities unwelcome or inaccessible, leading many to turn to technology-mediated experiences, as a safer alternative means of supporting recreational play with non-proximal relational partners.
